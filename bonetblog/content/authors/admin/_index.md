Hello World, I am David, a computational physicist who loves to solve problems âœ¨

The problems I am facing lately have to do with the very legos that define who we are: DNA. In particular, I deal with DNA Microscopy ðŸ§¬

DNA Microscopy aims to map spatial information through DNA, as opposed to classic approaches which use light. Image obtention from DNA is challenging. It involves math, computer science, and passion ðŸ’»

Outside my academic endeavours I like to hike and enjoy nature. I also write from time to time about whatever catches my attention :pen: :mountain:
