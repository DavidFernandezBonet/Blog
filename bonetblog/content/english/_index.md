This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```

# Biography
Hello World, I am David, a computational physicist who loves to solve problems :sparkles:

The problems I am facing lately have to do with the very legos that define who we are: DNA. In particular, I deal with DNA Microscopy :dna:

DNA Microscopy aims to map spatial information through DNA, as opposed to classic approaches which use light.
Image obtention from DNA is challenging. It involves math, computer science, and passion :computer:

Outside my academic endeavours I like to hike and enjoy nature. I also write from time to time about whatever catches my attention.

# Interests
